# `mpv_script_libs`

----

## What are these?

These are some modules and/or tools I use in my mpv Lua scripts (such as [mpv_crop_script](https://github.com/theamm/mpv_crop_script) and [mpv_thumbnail_script](https://github.com/theamm/mpv_thumbnail_script)). They've been written to be separate from the main scripts from the start, and duplicating commits between repositories to keep them up to date is bothersome, so I've collected them in their own repository.  
(These are not mpv Lua scripts. They won't work as-is.)
